Problem 503 : Next Greater Element II
Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), 
return the next greater number for every element in nums.

The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order 
next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. 
If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this number.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]

For every element, find the first greater element to its right. Since the array is circular, after reaching the last element, we continue checking from the beginning.
Use a monotonic decreasing stack.
1. Traverse the array twice using i % n.
2. If the stack is not empty and nums[stack.top()] < nums[i % n]:
   - The current element is the next greater element for the stack-top index.
   - Pop it and assign the answer.
3. During the first pass, push indices into the stack.
4. During the second pass, only resolve elements; don't push new indices.
5. Elements remaining in the stack have no greater element → -1.
